# LLM-Lab

LLM-Lab is a collection of experiments and projects focused on mastering Large Language Models (LLMs). It explores various techniques, from data engineering to fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and deployment.

## Repository Structure

- **Fine_Tuning/**: Scripts and notebooks for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on custom datasets.
- **Data_Engineering/**: Tools for collecting and cleaning datasets for NLP tasks.
- **RAG_Pipeline/**: Implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.
- **Deployment/**: End-to-end pipelines for deploying LLMs in production environments.
- **Evaluation/**: Tools for benchmarking and optimizing LLM performance.
- **Tools/**: Utilities for LLM experimentation.
